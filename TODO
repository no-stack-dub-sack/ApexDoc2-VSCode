    ☐ Add LICENSE file!! Research what license should be taking into account original ApexDoc

Testing:
    ✔ Establish "Snapshot" tests to compare output docs to expected output reference files @done(19-05-28 21:25)
    ✔ Create at least basic documentation engine tests @done(19-05-28 21:25)

Phase Two:
    ☐ Namespace tag (and global setting?)
    ☐ "Stub All" command
    ☐ Method, Interface, Enum menu hierarchy
    ☐ Configuration options for comment stubs (default tags for methods / classes)
    ☐ Support TODO and Hack tags?
    ☐ Put link to open docs in "Complete" notification if possible
    ☐ User defined CSS stylesheet that allows overriding current styles
    ☐ Trigger documentation!!
    ☐ Dark / Light themes?
    ☐ Method & Props headers should hide on a per class basis when filters toggled leave no methods or props left in that class. Currently, all methods or props of a given scope must be hidden (throughout all parent and child classes) before the header will hide itself.
    ☐ Child classes are not subject to scope filtering. Should private inner classes be hidden when private scope is un-checked?
